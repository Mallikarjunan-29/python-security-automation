Title: Domain Hijacking and DNS Compromise Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1584.001, T1583.001
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: DNS Infrastructure, Domain Registrar, External
Tools: DNS Monitoring, WHOIS, Domain Registrar Portal, SSL Certificate Monitoring
DETECTION:

Unauthorized DNS record changes
WHOIS information modifications (registrant, nameservers)
Domain transfer notifications from registrar
SSL/TLS certificate mismatch alerts
Email delivery failures (MX record changes)
Website redirecting to unexpected locations
Domain expiration alerts

INVESTIGATION:

Check domain registrar account:

Recent login activity (IPs, timestamps)
Account changes (email, password, 2FA)
Transfer lock status
Authorization code access


Review DNS records:

Compare current vs historical records
When were changes made?
What records were modified (A, MX, TXT, NS)?


Check WHOIS history:

Registrant information changes
Nameserver modifications
Domain transfer history


Verify SSL certificates:

Certificate validity and issuer
Certificate transparency logs


Check email for:

Domain transfer authorization requests
Password reset attempts
Registrar notifications



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Contact domain registrar immediately
Lock domain transfers if not already locked
Revert unauthorized DNS changes
Reset registrar account password
Enable/verify 2FA on registrar account
Cancel any pending domain transfers

CONTAINMENT:

Update all registrar account security settings
Enable registry lock (if available)
Review all domains in portfolio for similar compromise
Change admin contacts and email addresses
Enable DNSSEC if not already active
Implement CAA records to prevent unauthorized SSL issuance
Review and rotate API keys for DNS management

POST-INCIDENT:

Document timeline of hijacking and restoration
Notify users/customers of potential phishing risk
Monitor for phishing sites using hijacked domain
Legal action consideration for domain theft
Review SSL certificates issued during compromise
Implement domain monitoring service

LESSONS LEARNED:

Enable registrar account 2FA/MFA
Use registry lock service for critical domains
Separate email accounts for domain management
Regular domain portfolio audits
Monitor DNS changes with alerting
Document domain recovery procedures
Maintain offline backup of DNS records
Use domain privacy protection services carefully
