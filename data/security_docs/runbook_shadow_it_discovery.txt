Title: Shadow IT and Unauthorized Cloud Services Response
Severity: Medium
MITRE ATT&CK: T1567
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Network, Cloud, SaaS Applications
Tools: CASB, Web Proxy, Network Monitoring, SIEM, Cloud Discovery Tools
DETECTION:

Unauthorized cloud service usage detected
Data uploads to non-approved cloud storage
OAuth token grants to unknown applications
Unmanaged devices accessing corporate data
Cloud services bypassing security controls
Personal cloud accounts used for corporate data
SaaS applications not in approved software list

INVESTIGATION:

Identify unauthorized services:

What cloud services/applications are being used?
Who is using them and from which departments?
What data is being stored or transmitted?
How widespread is the usage?


Check web proxy/CASB logs:

URLs accessed and frequency
Data upload volumes
User accounts and authentication methods
OAuth permissions granted


Determine business justification:

Why are users using shadow IT?
Is there a legitimate business need?
Are approved alternatives available?


Assess security risks:

What data is at risk? (PII, trade secrets, credentials)
Are services GDPR/HIPAA compliant if required?
Data residency and sovereignty concerns?
Weak authentication or lack of MFA?



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Block high-risk unauthorized cloud services at proxy/firewall
Revoke OAuth tokens for critical shadow IT apps
Contact users to understand business requirements
Prevent data uploads to unauthorized cloud storage

CONTAINMENT:

Review all discovered shadow IT services for risk level
Migrate data from shadow IT to approved solutions
Implement CASB for cloud service visibility and control
Update web filtering policies to block/warn on shadow IT
Engage with users to understand and address needs
Provide approved alternatives for legitimate use cases

POST-INCIDENT:

Document all shadow IT services discovered
Create approved software and cloud service catalog
Implement cloud service procurement process
Security awareness training on shadow IT risks
Regular cloud discovery scans for new shadow IT
Update IT service offerings based on user needs

LESSONS LEARNED:

Deploy Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)
Regular cloud discovery and assessment
Approved software catalog and procurement process
User education on shadow IT risks
Provide approved alternatives for common needs
DLP policies to prevent data leakage to shadow IT
OAuth token monitoring and management
Shadow IT dashboard for IT security visibility
