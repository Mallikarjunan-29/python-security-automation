Title: IoT Device Compromise Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1200, T1542
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: IoT Devices, OT Networks, Physical Security Systems
Tools: Network Monitoring, SIEM, IoT Security Platform, Network Traffic Analysis
DETECTION:

Unusual traffic from IoT devices (cameras, sensors, smart devices)
IoT devices participating in botnet activity
Default credentials detected on IoT devices
Firmware tampering or unauthorized updates
IoT device scanning internal network
Unexpected outbound connections from IoT devices
Failed authentication attempts on IoT management interfaces

INVESTIGATION:

Identify compromised IoT device:

Device type, manufacturer, model
Firmware version
Default credentials in use?
When was device deployed?


Check network activity:

C2 communications
Scanning activity
Data exfiltration (video feeds, sensor data)
Botnet participation (DDoS attacks)


Review device configuration:

Open ports and services
Management interface exposure
Authentication mechanisms


Check for known vulnerabilities:

CVEs affecting device model
Manufacturer security advisories


Identify attack vector:

Internet-facing device with default credentials?
Exploitation of known vulnerability?
Physical access compromise?



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Isolate compromised IoT device from network
Block C2 domains/IPs at network perimeter
Disable remote access to IoT management interfaces
Change default credentials on all IoT devices

CONTAINMENT:

Update firmware to latest secure version
Factory reset compromised devices
Segment IoT devices into separate VLAN
Implement firewall rules restricting IoT traffic
Disable unnecessary services on IoT devices
Remove devices from internet exposure
Check all similar IoT devices for compromise

POST-INCIDENT:

Document all compromised IoT devices
Review IoT security architecture
Implement IoT device inventory and monitoring
Update network segmentation for IoT
Replace devices that cannot be secured
Monitor IoT devices for 30 days for reinfection

LESSONS LEARNED:

Change all default credentials on deployment
Network segmentation for IoT devices
Restrict internet access for IoT devices
Regular firmware updates and patch management
IoT security assessment during procurement
Disable unnecessary features and services
Monitor IoT device behavior with baseline
Consider replacing insecure legacy IoT devices
