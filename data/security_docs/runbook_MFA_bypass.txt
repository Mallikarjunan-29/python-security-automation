Title: Multi-Factor Authentication Bypass Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1078, T1556
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Authentication Systems, Cloud Services, VPN
Tools: SIEM, Authentication Logs, MFA Logs, User Behavior Analytics
DETECTION:

Excessive MFA push notifications sent to user
MFA approved at unusual times (3 AM, weekends)
Multiple MFA denials followed by approval
MFA bypass via legacy authentication protocols
MFA enrollment changes from unusual locations
Impossible travel with successful MFA
Social engineering of help desk to reset MFA
MFA fatigue attack patterns (100+ push notifications)

INVESTIGATION:

Check MFA logs:

Number of MFA requests sent to user
Time pattern of MFA requests (repeated every minute?)
Which MFA request was approved?
Source IP of authentication after MFA approval
User's location vs authentication location


Interview affected user:

Did they approve MFA push notification?
Were they bombarded with requests?
Did they contact help desk about MFA issues?
Any phishing or social engineering attempts?


Review authentication timeline:

Failed login attempts before MFA fatigue?
Account activity after MFA bypass
Changes made to account post-compromise
Access to sensitive data or systems


Check for other attack vectors:

SIM swapping for SMS-based MFA?
Help desk social engineering for MFA reset?
Legacy authentication protocols bypassing MFA?



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Suspend compromised account immediately
Force logout all active sessions
Reset account password and MFA enrollment
Block attacker IP addresses
Alert help desk of potential social engineering attempts

CONTAINMENT:

Re-enroll user in MFA with stronger method (FIDO2 key)
Disable legacy authentication protocols
Review all account access during compromise window
Check for unauthorized changes to account or data
Implement number matching for push notifications
Educate user on MFA fatigue attacks

POST-INCIDENT:

Document MFA bypass method and timeline
Review help desk procedures for MFA resets
Implement stricter controls for MFA changes
Monitor account for 30 days for suspicious activity
Update authentication policies

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement MFA with number matching or FIDO2 keys
Limit number of MFA requests per time period
Alert users and security team on excessive MFA denials
Disable legacy authentication protocols (SMTP AUTH, POP, IMAP)
Conditional access policies (device compliance, location)
Help desk verification procedures for MFA resets
User training on MFA fatigue and social engineering
Risk-based authentication (step-up authentication)
