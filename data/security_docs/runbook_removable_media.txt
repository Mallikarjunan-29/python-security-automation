Title: Malicious USB/Removable Media Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1091, T1052.001
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Endpoints, Physical Security
Tools: EDR, DLP, USB Monitoring, Endpoint Protection
DETECTION:

Unauthorized USB device insertion
AutoRun malware execution from removable media
Suspicious files copied from USB device
USB device with hidden partitions or files
USB-related malware signatures detected
Files executed immediately after USB insertion
USB devices violating DLP policies

INVESTIGATION:

Check EDR/DLP logs for:

USB device details (vendor ID, product ID, serial number)
User who inserted device
Files accessed/executed from USB
Timestamp of USB insertion
Files copied to/from USB


Analyze USB contents:

Scan USB device for malware
Check for AutoRun.inf files
Hidden files or partitions
Suspicious executables or scripts


Identify malicious activity:

Did malware execute from USB?
Was data exfiltrated to USB?
Lateral spread to other systems via USB?


Determine source of USB device:

Employee-owned device?
Lost and found device (social engineering)?
Vendor/contractor device?



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Isolate endpoint where USB was inserted
Quarantine USB device for forensic analysis
Kill any processes launched from USB
Block USB serial number in EDR/DLP

CONTAINMENT:

Scan endpoint for malware from USB
Run Malware Infection Runbook if infection confirmed
Check for files copied to USB (data exfiltration?)
Review all systems accessed by user for USB malware spread
Disable AutoRun/AutoPlay organization-wide if not already done

POST-INCIDENT:

Forensic analysis of USB device
Interview user about USB device origin
Document malware or data exfiltration findings
Update USB device policy
Security awareness training on USB risks

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement USB device whitelisting
Disable AutoRun/AutoPlay on all systems
DLP monitoring for USB data transfers
Physical security controls (USB port locks)
Endpoint protection scanning removable media
Alternative file transfer methods (cloud, secure file transfer)
Security awareness on social engineering USB drops
