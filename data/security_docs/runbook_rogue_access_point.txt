Title: Rogue Wireless Access Point Detection and Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1200, T1557
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Wireless Network, Physical Infrastructure
Tools: Wireless IDS/IPS, Network Monitoring, Site Survey Tools, Wireshark
DETECTION:

Unauthorized wireless access point detected
Duplicate SSID of corporate network
Evil twin attack indicators
Wireless clients connecting to unknown MAC addresses
Unusual wireless traffic patterns
Devices connected to non-corporate APs from inside facility
Man-in-the-middle attack signatures

INVESTIGATION:

Identify rogue access point:

SSID and BSSID (MAC address)
Physical location via signal triangulation
Is it bridging to corporate network?
Encryption type and security settings


Determine intent:

Evil twin (identical SSID to corporate)?
Credential harvesting portal?
Network bridge for unauthorized access?
Employee convenience device (unintentional)?


Check for connected clients:

Who connected to rogue AP?
What data was transmitted?
Credential theft or data interception?


Physical investigation:

Badge access logs near AP location
Security camera footage
Visual inspection of suspected area



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Physically locate and disable rogue access point
Alert security team for physical investigation
Force disconnect clients from rogue AP
Enable wireless IDS/IPS to block rogue AP

CONTAINMENT:

Remove rogue access point from facility
Force password reset for users who connected to rogue AP
Check network for unauthorized devices
Review network access logs for suspicious activity
Verify no additional rogue APs in facility

POST-INCIDENT:

Interview users who connected to rogue AP
Review physical security procedures
Document rogue AP details (make, model, configuration)
Determine if insider threat or external attacker
Notify legal/HR if employee involved

LESSONS LEARNED:

Deploy wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS)
Regular wireless site surveys
802.1X authentication for wireless networks
Certificate-based authentication (no passwords)
Physical security awareness for network equipment
Monitoring for rogue APs 24/7
Employee training on wireless security
