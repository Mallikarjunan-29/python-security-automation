Runbook 15: Compromised Cloud Account
Title: Cloud Account Compromise Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1078.004, T1550
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: AWS, Azure, GCP, Office 365
Tools: Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), SIEM, Cloud Native Logs, CASB
DETECTION:

Login from unusual geographic location
Impossible travel (logins from distant locations in short time)
API calls from unknown IP addresses
Resource creation/deletion (EC2 instances, VMs, storage)
Privilege escalation in cloud IAM
Large data downloads from cloud storage
Cloud service configuration changes
MFA disabled or authentication policy changes

INVESTIGATION:

Check cloud audit logs (CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, GCP Audit):

Source IP addresses and geolocation
API calls made (what actions taken?)
Resources created/modified/deleted
IAM/permission changes
Data access patterns


Verify account legitimacy:

Contact account owner to confirm activity
Check if credentials leaked (HaveIBeenPwned, leaked credential feeds)
Recent password changes or MFA modifications?


Review authentication logs:

Successful logins from suspicious IPs
Failed login attempts before success
MFA bypass or authentication anomalies


Check for cryptocurrency mining:

Unusual compute resource creation (large instances)
High cloud bills or resource usage spikes



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Rotate compromised credentials immediately
Revoke active sessions and access tokens
Enable MFA if not already active
Block suspicious IP addresses in cloud firewall/security groups
Suspend compromised account temporarily

CONTAINMENT:

Delete unauthorized resources (EC2 instances, VMs, storage buckets)
Revert unauthorized IAM/permission changes
Review all API keys and rotate if compromised
Check for backdoor accounts or service principals created
Verify no data exfiltration from cloud storage
Review billing for fraudulent resource usage
Enable cloud security monitoring if not active

POST-INCIDENT:

Force password reset for affected account
Enforce conditional access policies (IP restrictions, device compliance)
Enable cloud logging and alerting
Document unauthorized actions taken
Review cloud security posture
Conduct security awareness training

LESSONS LEARNED:

Enforce MFA for all cloud accounts
Implement conditional access policies
Monitor for impossible travel and anomalous access
Regular cloud security audits
Principle of least privilege for IAM roles
Enable cloud security services (GuardDuty, Security Center, Security Command Center)
API key rotation policies
