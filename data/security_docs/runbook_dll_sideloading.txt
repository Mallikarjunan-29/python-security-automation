Title: DLL Side-Loading Detection and Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1574.002
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Endpoints, Windows Systems
Tools: EDR (Crowdstrike, Defender, Sentinel One), SIEM, Sysmon, Process Monitor
DETECTION:

Legitimate signed applications loading unsigned/suspicious DLLs
DLLs loaded from unexpected paths (temp, appdata, downloads)
Known vulnerable applications loading malicious DLLs
EDR alerts for DLL hijacking behavior
Sysmon Event ID 7 (Image loaded) anomalies
Applications loading DLLs with mismatched names/versions

INVESTIGATION:

Check EDR/Sysmon logs for:

Parent process loading malicious DLL
DLL file path and hash
DLL signature and version info
Timeline of DLL creation and loading


Identify legitimate application:

Is it a known vulnerable application?
Check vendor advisories for DLL side-loading issues
Verify application integrity


Analyze malicious DLL:

Submit hash to VirusTotal, Any.run
Decompile or analyze in sandbox
Check for C2 communications
Identify malware family if known


Check for related files:

Additional DLLs in same directory
Configuration files
Payload executables



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Isolate infected endpoint immediately
Kill parent process loading malicious DLL
Quarantine malicious DLL files
Block C2 IPs/domains if identified

CONTAINMENT:

Delete malicious DLL and related files
Restore legitimate DLL if replaced
Check all systems for same DLL hash
Verify application integrity and reinstall if necessary
Run Malware Infection Runbook for complete system analysis
Check for persistence mechanisms

POST-INCIDENT:

Document vulnerable application and DLL details
Update application or apply vendor patches
Monitor for DLL side-loading attempts
Collect IOCs for threat intelligence
Write incident summary

LESSONS LEARNED:

Application whitelisting with DLL verification
Monitor DLL loading from suspicious paths
Keep applications updated to prevent known DLL hijacking
Enable SYSMON Event ID 7 logging
Implement DLL signature verification
Regular EDR rule tuning for DLL anomalies
