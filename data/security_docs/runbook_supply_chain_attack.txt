Title: Supply Chain Compromise Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1195, T1199
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Software Development, Third-Party Vendors, Update Mechanisms
Tools: Software Composition Analysis (SCA), SIEM, EDR, Vulnerability Scanners
DETECTION:

Malicious code detected in third-party software/library
Suspicious updates from trusted vendors
Integrity check failures for software packages
Unexpected network connections from trusted applications
Security advisories about compromised software supply chain
Hash mismatches for software packages
Digital signature verification failures

INVESTIGATION:

Identify affected software/vendor:

Which applications/libraries are compromised?
When was malicious version released?
What is the attack vector (backdoor, trojan, malware)?


Inventory affected systems:

Which systems have compromised software installed?
What versions are deployed?
Are systems internet-facing or internal?


Check vendor communications:

Has vendor acknowledged compromise?
Are patches/clean versions available?
What is vendor's recommended remediation?


Review software behavior:

What malicious actions has software performed?
Data exfiltration? C2 communications?
Lateral movement or persistence mechanisms?


Check threat intelligence for IOCs

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Isolate systems running compromised software
Block C2 domains/IPs associated with supply chain attack
Halt deployment of affected software versions
Quarantine malicious binaries

CONTAINMENT:

Uninstall compromised software versions
Deploy clean versions or patches from vendor
Verify integrity of all software installations (hash checks)
Check for persistence mechanisms installed by malicious software
Review all actions taken by compromised software (logs)
Run Malware Infection Runbook if additional malware deployed

POST-INCIDENT:

Document all affected systems and remediation actions
Notify affected customers/partners if applicable
Review vendor security assessment process
Update software inventory and version tracking
Monitor for secondary attacks leveraging compromise
Contact vendor for incident details and lessons learned

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement software composition analysis (SCA)
Verify digital signatures and hashes for all software
Maintain software bill of materials (SBOM)
Regular vendor security assessments
Implement network segmentation to limit impact
Automated vulnerability scanning for third-party components
Incident response plan for supply chain scenarios
