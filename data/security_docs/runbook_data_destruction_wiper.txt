Title: Data Destruction and Wiper Malware Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1485, T1490
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Endpoints, File Servers, Storage Systems
Tools: EDR, SIEM, Backup Systems, Forensics Tools, Data Recovery
DETECTION:

Mass file deletion events across file servers
Master Boot Record (MBR) or disk partition deletion
Shadow copy deletion (vssadmin delete shadows)
Overwriting of critical system files
Database deletion or corruption
Backup system deletion attempts
Disk wiping utilities detected
System boot failures across multiple endpoints

INVESTIGATION:

Check EDR logs for:

Process performing file deletion or disk wiping
User account or system context
Files and directories targeted
Timestamp and spread pattern
Wiper malware signatures (if known variant)


Identify affected systems:

Number of endpoints affected
File servers and shared storage impacted
Databases destroyed or corrupted
Backup systems accessed or deleted


Determine wiper type:

File-based wiper (deletes files, documents)
Disk wiper (overwrites MBR, partitions)
Database wiper (drops tables, corrupts data)
Ransomware disguised as wiper


Assess data loss:

What data is unrecoverable?
Are backups intact and accessible?
Business impact of data destruction



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Isolate affected systems immediately (network disconnect)
DO NOT reboot systems (may complete MBR wipe)
Block wiper malware hashes and C2 infrastructure
Protect backup systems - take offline or air-gap
Stop wiper processes if still active

CONTAINMENT:

Prevent spread to additional systems
Isolate file servers and critical data repositories
Segment network to protect unaffected systems
Kill wiper processes on all endpoints
Remove wiper malware following Malware Infection Runbook
Check for additional persistence mechanisms

POST-INCIDENT:

Restore data from backups (verify backup integrity first)
Rebuild systems from clean images if MBR wiped
Document data loss and recovery timeline
Report to law enforcement if destructive attack
Notify legal/compliance teams
Calculate business impact and downtime
Forensic analysis of wiper malware

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement 3-2-1 backup strategy (3 copies, 2 media, 1 offsite)
Air-gapped or immutable backups to prevent deletion
Regular backup testing and restoration drills
EDR with anti-tampering for shadow copy protection
File integrity monitoring on critical systems
Network segmentation to limit wiper spread
Incident response plan for data destruction scenarios
Disaster recovery procedures regularly tested
