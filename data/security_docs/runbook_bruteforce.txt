Title: Brute Force Credential Attack
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1110
Version: 1.1
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Enterprise endpoints, Directory Services
Tools: EDR platforms, Authentication logs, SIEM solutions, Threat intelligence feeds

DETECTION THRESHOLDS:
- Minimum 10 authentication failures
- Concentrated on single identity
- Origin from singular network address
- Temporal window of 10 minutes or less
- Windows Event IDs: 4625 (failed auth), 4771 (Kerberos failure)

DETECTION:
- SIEM alert activates on concentrated authentication failure sequence
- Attack pattern: High-volume attempts against single credential
- Query correlation engines to distinguish from password spray
- External attack sources warrant elevated concern
- Rapid succession indicates automated tooling

INVESTIGATION:
- Collect authentication telemetry: Timestamps, source networks, targeted identity, affected infrastructure
- Conduct contextual analysis:
  - Survey additional targets from attacking address
  - Determine privilege level of targeted account
  - Search for successful authentication following failure sequence
  - Enumerate concurrent sessions for targeted identity
  - Query endpoint detection platforms for process anomalies
  - Examine system behavior:
    - Credential harvesting tool execution
    - Scripting language abuse from unexpected contexts
    - Persistence mechanism establishment
- Validate attacking address against threat intelligence sources
- Analyze authentication cadence: Inter-attempt intervals, credential variations

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Enforce network perimeter blocking for attacking sources (90-day duration)
- Enable mandatory second-factor authentication for compromised identity
- Execute credential rotation for targeted account
- Revoke all active sessions if breach confirmed

CONTAINMENT:
- Isolate endpoint via EDR if system compromise detected
- Execute malware investigation procedures for suspicious artifacts
- Reassess and constrain account privileges appropriately
- Search for credential theft indicators in process memory
- Maintain heightened monitoring for 48-hour period

POST-INCIDENT:
- Document attack indicators in centralized threat database
- Author detailed incident narrative covering timeline and remediation
- Deploy account lockout policies if not currently implemented

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Enhance detection thresholds based on attack profile
- Review authentication security posture organization-wide
- Distribute indicators to threat intelligence community
- Evaluate login endpoint protection mechanisms
