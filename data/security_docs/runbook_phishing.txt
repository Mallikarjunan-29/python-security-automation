Title: Phishing Campaign Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1566
Version: 1.1
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Email infrastructure, Messaging platforms
Tools: Email security gateway, SIEM, Threat intelligence, Sandbox analysis platforms

EMAIL AUTHENTICATION INDICATORS:
- SPF validation failure or soft-fail status
- DKIM signature absence or validation failure
- DMARC policy failure
- Sender domain mismatch with reply-to address
- Domain registration under 30 days
- Generic salutations lacking personalization
- Urgency-inducing language patterns

DETECTION:
- End-user reports suspicious correspondence to security team
- Email gateway automatic blocking based on reputation or content
- SIEM pattern matching for known phishing characteristics
- Anti-phishing platform alerts

INVESTIGATION:
- Acquire original message in native format for analysis
- Email header examination:
  - Validate SPF, DKIM, DMARC authentication results
  - Assess sender domain reputation via threat intelligence
  - Extract and analyze embedded URLs against multiple databases
  - Hash attachments and cross-reference with malware repositories
  - Detonate suspicious files in isolated sandbox environment
- Email distribution analysis via gateway logs
- Web proxy correlation for URL access post-delivery
- Authentication log analysis for credential submission indicators
- EDR query for attachment execution events

USER INTERACTION ASSESSMENT:
- No interaction: Direct user to delete and report
- Link accessed without credential entry: 24-hour user activity monitoring
- Credentials submitted: Immediate containment procedures

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Instruct non-interacting users to avoid engagement with message
- Enforce permanent sender domain blocking at email gateway
- Add malicious URLs to web proxy deny lists
- Quarantine all message instances organization-wide
- Issue enterprise-wide alert for widespread campaigns

CONTAINMENT:
- Credential compromise scenario:
  - Force immediate credential reset
  - Terminate all active authentication sessions
  - Enable multi-factor authentication mandate
  - Audit account for abuse indicators: Anomalous access, mailbox rules, data access
  - Inspect inbox rules for auto-forwarding mechanisms
  - Review sent items for subsequent phishing propagation
- Attachment execution scenario:
  - Invoke malware investigation procedures
  - Deploy endpoint network isolation
  - Terminate malicious process tree
  - Hunt for lateral movement indicators

POST-INCIDENT:
- Document complete indicator set: Addresses, domains, URLs, file hashes
- Enhance email filtering rules with new patterns
- Deploy targeted security awareness training
- Issue organization-wide security bulletin for major campaigns
- Integrate indicators into threat intelligence feeds

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Audit email gateway effectiveness against observed evasion
- Tune security controls based on attack characteristics
- Evaluate additional protective layers: Link rewriting, attachment sandboxing
- Schedule phishing simulation exercises for high-risk populations
