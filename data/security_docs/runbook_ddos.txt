Title: Distributed Denial of Service Attack Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1498, T1499
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Network Infrastructure, Web Applications, Cloud
Tools: DDoS Mitigation Service (Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS Shield), Firewall, Network Monitoring, SIEM
DETECTION:

Sudden spike in inbound traffic volume
Increased bandwidth utilization (near or at capacity)
High connection count to specific services
Application slowness or unavailability
Abnormal traffic patterns (SYN floods, UDP floods, HTTP floods)
Traffic from botnet IP ranges
Geographically distributed attack sources

INVESTIGATION:

Identify attack type:

Volumetric (bandwidth exhaustion): ICMP flood, UDP flood, DNS amplification
Protocol (state exhaustion): SYN flood, fragmented packets
Application layer: HTTP GET/POST flood, Slowloris


Analyze traffic characteristics:

Source IPs and geographic distribution
Target ports and services
Packet types and patterns
Attack traffic volume (Gbps/packets per second)


Check network monitoring tools:

Bandwidth graphs and utilization
Dropped packet rates
CPU/memory on network devices


Review logs for attack indicators:

Repeated connections from same sources
Malformed packets or unusual patterns



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Activate DDoS mitigation service (Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS Shield)
Contact ISP for upstream filtering/blackholing
Enable rate limiting on affected services
Block obvious attack source IPs (if not distributed)
Scale infrastructure if possible (cloud auto-scaling)

CONTAINMENT:

Implement geo-blocking if attack from specific regions
Use traffic scrubbing services to filter malicious traffic
Deploy challenge-response mechanisms (CAPTCHA) for web applications
Enable SYN cookies for SYN flood mitigation
Implement connection rate limiting per IP
Reduce DNS TTL to facilitate rapid changes
Consider temporarily reducing service functionality to core features

POST-INCIDENT:

Document attack timeline, duration, and impact
Analyze traffic captures for attack patterns
Calculate business impact (downtime, revenue loss)
Review DDoS mitigation effectiveness
Update runbooks with lessons from incident
Monitor for follow-up attacks (DDoS often precedes other attacks)

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement always-on DDoS protection
Establish DDoS response team and escalation procedures
Regular DDoS simulation exercises
Over-provision bandwidth capacity
Implement rate limiting and traffic filtering
Distribute infrastructure across multiple providers/regions
Maintain emergency contact list (ISP, DDoS mitigation vendors)
