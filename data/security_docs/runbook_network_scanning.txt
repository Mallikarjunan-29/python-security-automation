Title: Network Reconnaissance Activity
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1046
Version: 1.1
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Network infrastructure, Perimeter devices
Tools: Firewall platforms, SIEM, Threat intelligence

DETECTION THRESHOLDS:
- Port scan: Identical port probed across 50+ hosts within 5 minutes
- Host scan: 20+ ports probed on single system within 5 minutes
- Network sweep: 100+ connection attempts across multiple targets and ports

SCAN TYPE CLASSIFICATION:
- Vertical scan: Multiple ports on single target
- Horizontal scan: Single port across multiple targets
- Network sweep: Comprehensive multi-port, multi-host reconnaissance

DETECTION:
- SIEM alert indicating reconnaissance activity from source addresses
- External origin significantly more concerning than internal sources

INVESTIGATION:
- Extract scanning telemetry: Timeline, source addresses, target systems, probed ports
- Firewall policy review: Rules permitting reconnaissance traffic
- Threat intelligence correlation for attacking infrastructure

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Enforce 90-day network blocking for malicious sources (bidirectional)

CONTAINMENT:
- Isolate systems communicating with scan sources via EDR
- Execute malware investigation for compromised infrastructure
- If threat intelligence indicates campaign affiliation:
  - Hunt for campaign TTPs across environment
  - Search for campaign indicators organization-wide
- Review and harden firewall policies for critical infrastructure

CONTAINMENT VERIFICATION:
- Confirm scan cessation after source blocking
- Validate no backdoor communications from internal systems

POST-INCIDENT:
- Maintain centralized indicator repository
- Comprehensive incident documentation including attack timeline and response

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Detection logic refinement
- Campaign-based threat hunting if applicable
- Indicator distribution to threat intelligence community
- Critical infrastructure firewall policy audit and hardening
