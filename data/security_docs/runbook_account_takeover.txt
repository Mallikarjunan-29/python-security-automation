Title: Account Takeover Detection and Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1078, T1110
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Web Applications, SaaS, Cloud Services
Tools: SIEM, User Behavior Analytics (UBA), Authentication Logs, CASB
DETECTION:

Successful login after multiple failed attempts
Login from new device or location immediately after credential stuffing
Account activity patterns drastically different from baseline
Password reset followed by immediate account changes
Multiple account accesses from single IP address
Email forwarding rules created after compromise
Two-factor authentication disabled or modified
Account information changes (email, phone, recovery options)

INVESTIGATION:

Check authentication logs:

Timeline of login attempts (failed then successful)
Source IP addresses and geolocation
User agents and device fingerprints
MFA bypass or social engineering of MFA?


Review account activity post-compromise:

Email forwarding rules or filters created
Files accessed, downloaded, or shared
Account settings modified (password, recovery email, MFA)
Purchases or transactions made
Messages sent from account


Identify attack vector:

Credential stuffing from breach database?
Phishing for credentials?
Session hijacking or cookie theft?
MFA fatigue attack (push notification bombing)?


Check for lateral account compromise:

Same attacker IP accessing multiple accounts?
Password reuse enabling additional compromises?



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Suspend compromised account immediately
Force logout all active sessions
Reset account password
Block attacker IP addresses
Re-enable MFA if disabled

CONTAINMENT:

Remove malicious email forwarding rules
Delete unauthorized filters and email rules
Revoke OAuth tokens and application permissions
Undo unauthorized account changes
Review all account activity during compromise window
Check linked accounts for compromise
Verify no financial transactions or purchases

POST-INCIDENT:

Notify account owner of compromise
Document account activities during takeover
Review authentication policies and strengthen
Monitor account for 30 days for suspicious activity
Offer credit monitoring if financial data exposed
Security awareness training for affected users

LESSONS LEARNED:

Enforce strong MFA for all accounts (FIDO2/hardware keys preferred)
Implement impossible travel detection
Device fingerprinting and trust scoring
Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
Monitor for credential stuffing attacks proactively
CAPTCHA on login after failed attempts
Passwordless authentication where possible
User behavior analytics for anomaly detection
