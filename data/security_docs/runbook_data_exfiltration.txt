Title: Bulk Data Exfiltration Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1041
Version: 1.1
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Network perimeter, Endpoints, Cloud infrastructure
Tools: DLP platform, Firewall logging, Cloud access security broker, SIEM, NetFlow, EDR

DETECTION THRESHOLDS:
- Large-volume transfers exceeding 1 GB to external destinations within one hour
- Multiple file uploads surpassing 50 files in 30-minute window
- Compressed or encrypted artifact transfers over 500 MB
- Off-hours bulk transfers outside standard business hours
- High-entropy files exceeding 7.5 entropy score

DETECTION INDICATORS:
- Massive outbound data movement to external infrastructure
- File uploads to non-corporate cloud storage platforms
- Compressed or encrypted containers transferred externally
- After-hours data movement by user accounts
- Base64-encoded payloads in HTTP POST requests
- File transfer protocols to unexpected destinations

DETECTION:
- DLP alerts for sensitive information exiting network boundary
- Firewall high-volume outbound connection logging
- Cloud access security broker alerts for unauthorized uploads
- SIEM correlation: File access followed by compression and transmission

INVESTIGATION:
- Firewall and proxy log analysis:
  - Destination infrastructure identification
  - Aggregate transfer volume calculation
  - File type and compression status
  - Protocol characterization
  - Transfer timing analysis
- User activity correlation:
  - Pre-exfiltration file access patterns
  - Privilege elevation timeline
  - Authentication anomaly detection
  - Remote access session analysis
- Cloud service log examination:
  - Personal storage account uploads
  - File sharing platform activity
  - Code repository interactions
- Staging artifact analysis:
  - Archive file identification on endpoints
  - File metadata extraction
  - Source file reconstruction
- Insider threat indicator assessment:
  - Employment status changes
  - Disciplinary history
  - Elevated access beyond role requirements

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Block destination infrastructure at network perimeter
- Suspend account and revoke all access tokens
- Isolate affected endpoint preventing further data loss
- Preserve network traffic for forensic analysis
- Escalate to management and legal counsel

CONTAINMENT:
- Exfiltrated data identification:
  - DLP correlation for sensitive content
  - File access log analysis
  - Data classification determination
- Malware investigation for ransomware scenarios
- Cloud access token revocation
- Data access control review and correction
- Source file deletion analysis for evidence destruction

CONTAINMENT VERIFICATION:
- Confirm cessation of transfers from user and endpoint
- Validate account suspension across all systems
- Identify additional credentials under user control

POST-INCIDENT:
- Engage legal and compliance teams immediately
- Execute external party notification if required
- Deploy enhanced DLP policies organization-wide
- Audit data classification and access controls
- Conduct user behavior analytics review
- Consider law enforcement engagement for criminal activity

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE:
- Evaluate breach notification obligations
- Preserve evidence chain of custody
- Coordinate investigation scope with legal counsel

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Enable comprehensive DLP monitoring across egress points
- Establish data transfer baselines per user and department
- Deploy egress filtering for non-business destinations
- Implement cloud access security broker
- Deploy file integrity monitoring for sensitive repositories
- Execute insider threat awareness programs
