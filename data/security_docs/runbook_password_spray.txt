Title: Password Spray Attack Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1110.003
Version: 1.1
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Enterprise endpoints, Directory Services
Tools: EDR platforms, Authentication logs, SIEM solutions, Threat intelligence feeds

DETECTION THRESHOLDS:
- Minimum 3 authentication failures per account
- Attack surface spans 10 or more distinct accounts
- Temporal clustering within 30-minute intervals
- Origin from single or distributed source addresses
- Common password characteristics across attempts

DETECTION:
- SIEM correlation engine triggers on distributed authentication failure pattern
- Attack signature: Low-volume failures distributed across multiple identities
- Leverage SIEM query language to validate spray behavior versus brute force
- Threat actor typically originates from external network space
- Attack pattern exhibits breadth over depth (many users, few attempts each)

INVESTIGATION:
- Extract key telemetry from authentication logs: Attack timeline, originating addresses, victim identities
- Perform correlation analysis:
  - Enumerate all infrastructure targeted by source addresses
  - Validate victim accounts exist in directory services
  - Assess privilege assignments for all affected identities
  - Identify any successful authentications post-failure sequence
  - Examine authenticated sessions for anomalous behavior
  - Query process creation telemetry for suspicious execution
  - Analyze compromised systems for indicators:
    - Scripting interpreter invocation from atypical parent processes
    - File artifacts in transient user directories
    - Network connections to external destinations
- Cross-reference attacking addresses with community threat intelligence
- Construct attack chronology: Initial contact, persistence duration, compromise events

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Implement network-level blocking for malicious sources (90-day enforcement)
- Mandate multi-factor authentication for all targeted identities
- Initiate credential rotation for affected account population
- Terminate compromised sessions and disable affected accounts immediately

CONTAINMENT:
- Deploy network isolation for systems exhibiting post-compromise indicators
- Initiate malware investigation workflow for suspicious artifacts
- Apply principle of least privilege across affected account base
- Hunt for horizontal movement originating from compromised credentials
- Establish 48-hour monitoring window for all accessed systems

POST-INCIDENT:
- Maintain centralized repository of attack indicators for future correlation
- Generate comprehensive incident report documenting attack lifecycle and organizational response
- Evaluate authentication policy strength and implement improvements
- Distribute security awareness communications to affected user population

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Refine detection logic based on observed attack characteristics
- Conduct organization-wide authentication security assessment
- Integrate discovered indicators into threat intelligence framework
- Evaluate account lockout mechanisms for policy optimization
