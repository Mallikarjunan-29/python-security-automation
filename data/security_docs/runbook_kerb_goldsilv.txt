Title: Kerberos Golden/Silver Ticket Attack Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1558.001, T1558.002
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Active Directory, Domain Controllers, Endpoints
Tools: EDR, SIEM, Windows Event Logs, Active Directory Auditing
DETECTION:

Kerberos ticket anomalies (Event ID 4769, 4768, 4624)
Tickets with excessive lifetime (>10 hours)
Service tickets for non-existent services
Ticket requests from unusual locations/IPs
Account authentication without corresponding logon event
TGS requests with encryption downgrade (RC4 instead of AES)
Forged PAC signatures

INVESTIGATION:

Check Windows Security Event Logs:

Event ID 4768 (TGT requested)
Event ID 4769 (Service ticket requested)
Event ID 4624 (Successful logon)
Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned)


Analyze suspicious Kerberos tickets:

Ticket lifetime (Golden tickets often have 10-year lifetime)
Encryption type (RC4 vs AES256)
Account used (deleted or non-existent accounts)
Source IP and computer name


Determine attack type:

Golden Ticket: Full domain compromise, requires krbtgt hash
Silver Ticket: Service-specific, requires service account hash


Identify compromised accounts:

Which accounts are being impersonated?
Domain admin accounts targeted?


Check for credential dumping:

Was krbtgt or service account hash stolen?
Review Credential Dumping Runbook



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Isolate systems showing forged ticket usage
Disable suspicious user accounts
Block lateral movement from affected systems
Enable enhanced Kerberos auditing

CONTAINMENT:

For Golden Ticket:

Reset krbtgt account password TWICE (requires two resets)
Wait 10 hours between resets for ticket expiration
Force password reset for all privileged accounts
Invalidate all existing Kerberos tickets


For Silver Ticket:

Reset compromised service account password
Revoke existing service tickets
Monitor service access for anomalies


Check all Domain Controllers for compromise
Review systems accessed via forged tickets

POST-INCIDENT:

Rebuild Domain Controllers if fully compromised
Implement stricter Kerberos policies
Enable AES encryption for Kerberos (disable RC4)
Monitor Kerberos ticket requests for 60 days
Document attack timeline and compromised accounts

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement Microsoft ATA/Defender for Identity
Monitor Event IDs 4768, 4769, 4624, 4672
Regular krbtgt password rotation (annually)
Disable RC4 encryption for Kerberos
Protected Users security group for privileged accounts
Kerberos armoring (FAST) implementation
Enhanced Kerberos auditing and alerting
