Title: Privilege Escalation Detection and Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1068, T1134, T1548
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Endpoints, Active Directory
Tools: EDR, SIEM, Windows Event Logs, Active Directory Auditing
DETECTION:

Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon)
Event ID 4673 (Privileged service called)
Event ID 4674 (Operation attempted on privileged object)
Unusual UAC bypass attempts
Token manipulation activities
Service creation with SYSTEM privileges
Scheduled task creation with elevated privileges
Exploitation of kernel vulnerabilities

INVESTIGATION:

Check SIEM logs for:

User account involved and normal privilege level
Method of escalation (exploit, credential theft, token manipulation)
Timestamp and affected system
Processes running with elevated privileges


Verify account legitimacy:

Is user account compromised or malicious?
Recent password changes or suspicious logins?
Normal business justification for elevated access?


Check for known privilege escalation exploits:

Review installed patches and missing updates
Check for CVEs matching system configuration


Correlate with other alerts:

Recent malware infections?
Lateral movement attempts?
Data access after escalation?



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Suspend compromised user account in Active Directory
Isolate affected endpoint to prevent lateral movement
Kill processes running with suspicious elevated privileges
Revoke temporary admin rights if granted

CONTAINMENT:

Review all privileged actions taken after escalation
Check for persistence mechanisms (scheduled tasks, services, registry)
Verify no additional accounts created with admin rights
Remove malicious scheduled tasks, services, or registry entries
Run Malware Infection Runbook if malware facilitated escalation
Patch vulnerabilities exploited for escalation

POST-INCIDENT:

Force password reset for affected account
Review privileged access management policies
Audit all administrative group memberships
Monitor account for 30 days for suspicious activity
Document escalation method and remediation steps

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement least privilege principle organization-wide
Enable privileged access management (PAM) solution
Update vulnerable software and apply security patches
Monitor Windows Event IDs 4672, 4673, 4674 continuously
Implement JIT (Just-In-Time) administration
Regular vulnerability assessments
