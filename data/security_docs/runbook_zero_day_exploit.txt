Title: Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1190, T1203
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Network, Endpoints, Applications
Tools: EDR, IDS/IPS, SIEM, Vulnerability Scanners, Threat Intelligence Feeds
DETECTION:

IDS/IPS signatures for exploit attempts
Unusual application crashes or behavior
Unexpected code execution from trusted applications
Security vendor advisory about new zero-day
Threat intelligence reports of active exploitation
Memory corruption indicators
Abnormal process spawning from vulnerable applications

INVESTIGATION:

Identify vulnerability details:

CVE identifier (if assigned)
Affected software and versions
Exploitation method and requirements
Patch availability timeline


Inventory affected systems:

Which systems run vulnerable software?
Are they internet-facing or internal?
What is their criticality level?
What versions are deployed?


Check for exploitation indicators:

Review EDR/IDS logs for exploit attempts
Check for successful compromises
Malware deployment after exploitation?
Lateral movement from exploited systems?


Review threat intelligence:

Known threat actors exploiting vulnerability
Associated IOCs and TTPs
Exploitation difficulty level



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Isolate affected internet-facing systems if feasible
Implement virtual patching via WAF/IPS if available
Block known exploit traffic at network perimeter
Disable vulnerable features/services if possible
Monitor exploited systems for post-compromise activity

CONTAINMENT:

Apply vendor patches immediately when available
Implement workarounds per vendor guidance
Network segmentation to limit blast radius
Enhanced monitoring on vulnerable systems
Check for backdoors/persistence on exploited systems
Run Malware Infection Runbook if compromise detected

POST-INCIDENT:

Document all systems affected and remediation actions
Update vulnerability management process
Review detection capabilities for zero-day scenarios
Incident timeline and lessons learned documentation
Update threat intelligence feeds

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement virtual patching capabilities (WAF, IPS)
Regular vulnerability assessments
Network segmentation to reduce exposure
Emergency patch management procedures
Threat intelligence integration
Reduce attack surface (disable unnecessary services)
Endpoint protection with exploit prevention
Incident response drills for rapid zero-day response
