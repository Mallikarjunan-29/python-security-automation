Title: Slow-Rate Data Exfiltration
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1020, T1030
Version: 1.1
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Network perimeter, Endpoints, Data loss prevention
Tools: NetFlow analysis, Behavioral analytics, SIEM, DLP, Firewall logging, EDR

DETECTION THRESHOLDS:
- Sustained transfers: 10-100 MB daily over 7-day minimum
- Consistent destination addressing over extended period
- Off-hours transfer predominance (over 70 percent outside business hours)
- Transfer volumes approaching but not exceeding DLP thresholds
- Regular transfer timing suggesting automation

DETECTION:
- Persistent small-volume outbound transfers over extended timeline
- Intentional evasion of data loss prevention thresholds
- Unconventional protocols: ICMP tunneling, DNS encoding, steganographic methods
- Consistent off-hours or weekend data movement
- Traffic directed to non-business cloud services or anonymization networks

INVESTIGATION:
- NetFlow behavioral analysis:
  - Destination consistency tracking over time
  - Transfer pattern characterization: Timing, volumes, protocol selection
  - Baseline deviation measurement against historical norms
  - Aggregate volume calculation across entire attack window
- User activity correlation:
  - File access pattern alignment with transfer timeline
  - Authentication location and timing analysis
  - Recent privilege or role modifications
  - Remote access session review
- Steganographic artifact investigation:
  - File entropy analysis for hidden payloads
  - Size anomaly detection for file types
- Network capture analysis when available:
  - Protocol behavior examination
  - Destination service identification
- Data staging artifact detection:
  - Temporary file creation before transmission
  - Compressed archive generation timeline
  - Filesystem modification sequencing

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Enforce network blocking for identified destinations
- Suspend user account pending investigation completion
- Monitor for attack acceleration upon detection
- Capture network traffic for forensic preservation

CONTAINMENT:
- Aggregate total exfiltrated data across attack duration
- Identify accessed data during exfiltration window
- Survey for malware enabling sustained exfiltration
- Review comprehensive user file access history
- Isolate compromised endpoint if malware present
- Rotate credentials assuming full compromise

CONTAINMENT VERIFICATION:
- Confirm transfer cessation after destination blocking
- Validate no new staging directories or archives
- Hunt for alternative exfiltration channels

POST-INCIDENT:
- Deploy behavioral analytics for slow exfiltration patterns
- Configure alerts for consistent low-volume transfers
- Reassess DLP thresholds against evasion techniques
- Execute comprehensive endpoint forensics
- Determine data sensitivity classification
- Execute legal and regulatory notification requirements

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Establish transfer pattern baselines per user and department
- Deploy anomaly detection for unusual consistency patterns
- Monitor aggregate transfers temporally not just volumetrically
- Implement protocol-aware inspection beyond simple volume monitoring
- Deploy User and Entity Behavior Analytics platform
- Execute data classification and tagging initiatives
