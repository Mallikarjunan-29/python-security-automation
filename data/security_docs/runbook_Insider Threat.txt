Title: Insider Threat Detection and Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1530, T1213
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Endpoints, Network, Cloud, Data Repositories
Tools: DLP, SIEM, User Behavior Analytics (UBA), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), EDR
DETECTION:

Mass downloading of sensitive documents
Access to files outside normal job function
USB device usage policy violations
After-hours access to sensitive systems
Copying data to personal cloud storage
Database queries for large datasets
Printing sensitive documents before departure
Accessing competitor/recruiting websites

INVESTIGATION:

Build user profile and timeline:

Employment status (resignation submitted? performance issues?)
Recent access patterns vs historical baseline
File access logs (what was accessed/downloaded?)
Email activity (forwarding to personal email?)
Badge access logs (physical locations, after-hours?)


Check for data exfiltration:

USB device connections
Cloud storage uploads (Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive)
Large email attachments sent externally
Printing activity


Correlate with HR:

Performance reviews, disciplinary actions
Resignation or termination pending?
Access to sensitive projects/data legitimate?


Review privileged access usage

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

DO NOT immediately confront user (may accelerate data theft)
Suspend user accounts discreetly (after documenting activity)
Block personal cloud storage and USB devices
Enable more aggressive DLP monitoring for user
Preserve forensic evidence (disk images, logs)

CONTAINMENT:

Revoke all system access (Active Directory, applications, VPN)
Disable physical badge access
Change passwords for shared accounts user accessed
Review all data accessed during suspicious period
Check for forwarding rules in email
Verify no backdoor accounts created
Collect all company devices from employee

POST-INCIDENT:

Conduct forensic analysis of employee devices
Document all data accessed/exfiltrated
Notify legal team for potential litigation
Notify affected parties if sensitive data compromised
Review and update access controls
Exit interview and device collection procedures

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement User Behavior Analytics (UBA)
Automated alerts for abnormal data access patterns
Enforce principle of least privilege
Regular access reviews (quarterly)
DLP policies for sensitive data handling
Offboarding checklist and automation
Employee monitoring policies (with legal review)
