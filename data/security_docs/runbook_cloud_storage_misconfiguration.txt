Title: Cloud Storage Misconfiguration and Data Exposure Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1530
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage
Tools: Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), SIEM, Cloud Native Logs, DLP
DETECTION:

Publicly accessible cloud storage buckets discovered
CSPM alerts for misconfigured storage permissions
Anonymous access to storage containers
Data leak notifications from security researchers
Unexpected data download volumes from cloud storage
Storage bucket discovered in public search engines
DLP alerts for sensitive data in public storage

INVESTIGATION:

Identify misconfigured storage:

Storage bucket/container name and location
When was it created and by whom?
What permissions are configured? (public read/write?)
Who has accessed the storage recently?


Review storage contents:

What data is stored in the bucket?
Is it sensitive data (PII, credentials, proprietary)?
How many files and total data volume?
Are credentials or API keys stored in files?


Check access logs:

Who accessed the public bucket?
Source IPs and user agents
What files were downloaded?
When did public access begin?


Determine impact:

Was data indexed by search engines?
Any reports of data misuse?
Credentials exposed and compromised?



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Remove public access permissions immediately
Enable bucket/container access logging if not active
Rotate any credentials or API keys exposed
Request search engine removal (Google, Bing)

CONTAINMENT:

Review all cloud storage for similar misconfigurations
Implement least privilege access policies
Enable encryption at rest if not active
Remove sensitive data from storage or move to secure location
Audit all IAM policies for overly permissive access
Enable versioning to track data access history

POST-INCIDENT:

Notify legal/compliance teams of potential data breach
Document exposed data and access timeline
Calculate scope of exposure (duration, data volume)
Regulatory notification if required (GDPR, CCPA)
Review cloud security policies and training
Monitor for credential abuse if keys exposed

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
Block public access by default for all cloud storage
Regular cloud storage permission audits
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with security scanning
Automated detection of public storage buckets
Data classification and DLP for cloud storage
Security training on cloud storage configuration
Principle of least privilege for cloud IAM
