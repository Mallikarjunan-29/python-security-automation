Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Email, DNS, Web Applications
Tools: Email Security Gateway, DNS Monitoring, Certificate Transparency Logs, Threat Intelligence
DETECTION:

Newly registered domains similar to company domain
SSL certificates issued for lookalike domains
Phishing emails from typosquatted domains
Users visiting typosquatted domains (web proxy logs)
Brand monitoring alerts for similar domains
Homograph attacks using Unicode characters (compаny.com vs company.com)
Domain similarity alerts from threat intelligence feeds
User reports of suspicious emails or websites

INVESTIGATION:

Identify typosquatted domains:

Domain names registered (examp1e.com, exarnple.com)
Registration date and registrar information
WHOIS details and privacy protection
Hosting provider and IP addresses
SSL certificates issued for domains


Analyze malicious activity:

Phishing websites hosted on typosquatted domains
Email campaigns using spoofed domains
Credential harvesting pages
Malware distribution sites
Brand impersonation for fraud


Check for impacted users:

Who received phishing emails from typosquatted domains?
Did anyone visit malicious sites?
Were credentials entered on fake login pages?
Financial transactions or wire transfers requested?


Review threat intelligence:

Known campaigns using similar tactics
Attribution to specific threat actors
Related infrastructure and domains



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Block typosquatted domains at email gateway and web proxy
Alert users who received emails from typosquatted domains
Take down phishing sites (abuse reports to hosting provider)
Request domain suspension from registrar

CONTAINMENT:

Force password reset for users who visited phishing sites
Monitor for credential stuffing using harvested credentials
Block all similar typosquatted domains discovered
Implement DMARC, SPF, DKIM for email authentication
Register common typosquatting variations defensively
Monitor Certificate Transparency logs for lookalike domains

POST-INCIDENT:

Document all typosquatted domains and phishing infrastructure
Report to law enforcement and anti-phishing organizations
Register defensive domain variations
Implement brand monitoring and domain watching services
Security awareness training on typosquatting and phishing
Review email authentication effectiveness

LESSONS LEARNED:

Proactive registration of typosquatting variations
Brand monitoring and domain watching services
Certificate Transparency log monitoring
DMARC, SPF, DKIM implementation and enforcement
Email security gateway with lookalike domain detection
User awareness training on verifying domains
Browser protection against homograph attacks
Legal team engagement for trademark protection
Abuse reporting procedures to registrars and hosting providers
