Title: Abnormal Lateral Movement
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1078, T1021
Version: 1.1
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Enterprise network, Directory Services
Tools: EDR platforms, SIEM, Threat intelligence, Network monitoring

DETECTION THRESHOLDS:
- Host access count exceeding 3x baseline over 30-day period
- Access to previously unvisited systems
- Rapid sequential access within 10-minute windows
- Mix of successful and failed authentication attempts

DETECTION:
- SIEM correlation alert for unusual multi-host access patterns
- Validate criticality of accessed infrastructure
- Establish user's normal access baseline over 90-day window

INVESTIGATION:
- Authentication log analysis: Timestamps, identity, destination systems
- Historical baseline establishment:
  - Typical access volume over previous 30 days
  - Regularly accessed system inventory
  - Historical alert generation for this identity
  - Normal authentication patterns
- Current activity comparison against established baseline
- Build comprehensive user timeline:
  - Access frequency and volume trends
  - Target system enumeration
  - Alert history
  - Authentication pattern analysis
- Significance threshold: Current activity substantially exceeding baseline with unprecedented targets

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Suspend account immediately in directory services
- Investigate accessed systems for compromise indicators:
  - Novel process creation
  - External network communications
  - Office applications spawning unusual child processes
  - Execution from suspicious paths

CONTAINMENT:
- Isolate systems exhibiting post-compromise indicators
- Execute malware investigation for suspicious artifacts
- Mandate multi-factor authentication
- Rotate credentials for affected account
- Hunt across accessed systems for:
  - Credential dumping tools
  - Persistence mechanisms
  - Data staging activities
  - Additional compromised accounts

CONTAINMENT VERIFICATION:
- Confirm account suspension across all systems
- Validate no alternative credentials exist
- Verify isolation effectiveness

POST-INCIDENT:
- Extended 20-day monitoring for affected infrastructure
- Comprehensive incident documentation
- Baseline refinement based on attack characteristics

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Detection threshold optimization
- Comprehensive firewall rule audit
- Organization-wide MFA deployment initiative
- Access control principle review
