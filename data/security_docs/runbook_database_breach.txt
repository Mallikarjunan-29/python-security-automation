Title: Database Breach and Unauthorized Access Response
Severity: Critical
MITRE ATT&CK: T1552.001, T1530
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Database Servers, Cloud Databases, Data Repositories
Tools: Database Activity Monitoring (DAM), SIEM, Database Audit Logs, DLP
DETECTION:

Unusual database queries (bulk exports, SELECT *)
Access from unauthorized IP addresses
Privilege escalation in database
Failed authentication attempts to database
Data exfiltration detected by DLP
After-hours database access
Suspicious stored procedure execution
SQL injection detected by WAF

INVESTIGATION:

Check database audit logs:

What queries were executed?
Which user accounts accessed database?
Source IP addresses and applications
Timestamp and duration of access
Tables accessed (sensitive data?)


Determine scope of breach:

What data was accessed/exfiltrated?
How many records affected?
Data sensitivity level (PII, PHI, financial?)
Were records modified or deleted?


Identify attack vector:

SQL injection through web application?
Stolen database credentials?
Exposed database port to internet?
Insider threat?


Review authentication:

Legitimate user account or compromised?
Password spray or brute force before access?
Multi-factor authentication bypass?



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Suspend compromised database accounts
Block unauthorized source IPs at firewall
Rotate database credentials immediately
Take database snapshots for forensics
Enable enhanced audit logging

CONTAINMENT:

Patch SQL injection vulnerabilities in applications
Remove internet exposure of database ports
Implement network segmentation for database tier
Review and restrict database user privileges
Enable database firewall rules
Check for backdoor accounts or stored procedures
Verify no additional databases compromised

POST-INCIDENT:

Notify legal/compliance teams (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
Document breach scope and affected data
Prepare breach notification if required by regulation
Offer credit monitoring if PII exposed
Update database security policies
Conduct security code review of applications
Monitor for credential abuse or identity theft

LESSONS LEARNED:

Implement principle of least privilege for DB accounts
Database activity monitoring and alerting
Regular SQL injection testing of web applications
Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
Multi-factor authentication for database access
Network segmentation and firewall rules
Disable unnecessary database features and functions
Regular database security audits
Remove default/unused database accounts
