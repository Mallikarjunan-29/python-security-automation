Title: Container/Kubernetes Security Incident Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1610, T1611
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Kubernetes, Docker, Container Runtime
Tools: Kubernetes Audit Logs, Container Security Platform (Aqua, Sysdig, Prisma Cloud), SIEM, EDR
DETECTION:

Privileged container creation
Container escape attempts
Unauthorized access to Kubernetes API server
Suspicious container image pulls
Containers running as root
Host filesystem mounts in containers
Cryptocurrency mining in containers
Unusual outbound connections from containers

INVESTIGATION:

Check Kubernetes audit logs:

Who created/modified suspicious containers?
What RBAC permissions were used?
API server authentication attempts
ConfigMap/Secret access patterns


Review container configurations:

Image source and integrity
Runtime privileges (privileged mode, capabilities)
Volume mounts (especially host filesystem)
Network policies and pod-to-pod communication


Analyze container images:

Scan for vulnerabilities and malware
Check image provenance and signing
Review Dockerfile for suspicious commands


Check for:

Lateral movement between pods
Data exfiltration from containers
Persistence mechanisms (DaemonSets, CronJobs)



IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

Delete malicious pods/containers immediately
Block malicious container image registries
Rotate Kubernetes service account tokens
Isolate affected nodes if container escaped

CONTAINMENT:

Implement pod security policies/standards
Restrict container registry to approved images only
Remove unnecessary RBAC permissions
Patch vulnerable container images
Update Kubernetes to latest secure version
Enable network policies to restrict pod communication
Scan all running containers for vulnerabilities

POST-INCIDENT:

Review all container deployments for security issues
Implement image scanning in CI/CD pipeline
Document attack timeline and container configurations
Update container security baselines
Monitor for persistence mechanisms (backdoor containers)

LESSONS LEARNED:

Enforce container image signing and verification
Implement runtime security monitoring
Principle of least privilege for RBAC
Regular vulnerability scanning of container images
Disable privileged containers unless absolutely necessary
Network segmentation with network policies
Enable Kubernetes audit logging
Container security training for DevOps teams
