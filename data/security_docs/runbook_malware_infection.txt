Title: Malware Infection Response
Severity: High
MITRE ATT&CK: T1204, T1547
Version: 1.1
Last Updated: 15-Nov-2025
Author: Security Operations Team
Environment: Enterprise endpoints
Tools: EDR platforms, SIEM, Threat intelligence, Sandbox analysis

DETECTION:
- SIEM alert indicating malware presence on endpoint
- Distinguish between unknown threats and known malware classifications
- Validate detection source: Endpoint protection, behavioral analysis, signature match

INVESTIGATION:
- Extract core telemetry: Timestamps, affected systems, file hashes
- Threat intelligence correlation via multiple platforms
- Retrieve quarantined specimen for controlled detonation analysis
- Behavioral analysis in isolated environment
- Examine execution chain:
  - Initial infection vector
  - Parent process identification
  - Child process spawning
  - Network communication patterns
  - Filesystem modifications

MALWARE CLASSIFICATION:
- Identify malware family and variant
- Determine capabilities: Backdoor, ransomware, infostealer, wiper
- Assess lateral movement potential
- Evaluate persistence mechanisms

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Deploy immediate endpoint isolation via EDR
- Survey systems accessed by compromised account:
  - New process creation indicators
  - External communication establishment
  - Document reader applications spawning suspicious processes
  - Execution from unexpected directories

CONTAINMENT:
- Secure quarantine specimen in restricted environment
- Terminate complete malware process tree
- Sever all external command and control connections
- Eradicate all malware instances from affected system
- Remove persistence mechanisms:
  - Registry key modifications
  - Scheduled task entries
  - Service installations
  - Startup folder additions
- Credential rotation for affected accounts
- Hunt for lateral spread across network

FORENSIC PRESERVATION:
- Capture volatile memory before remediation
- Preserve filesystem timeline
- Extract network connection history
- Document all indicators for sharing

POST-INCIDENT:
- Sustained monitoring for 20-day period minimum
- Detailed incident narrative generation
- IOC extraction and distribution
- Organization-wide threat hunting campaign

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Detection rule optimization based on observed TTPs
- Threat intelligence feed updates
- User awareness training if social engineering involved
- Endpoint protection policy review
